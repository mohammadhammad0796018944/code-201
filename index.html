   <H2  style="color: crimson;">
    1 Love stories don't always have a happy ending. You might fall for someone who doesn't return your phone calls or dates 
    your best friend or simply doesn't feel the same way you do. DW, heartbreak won't stop you from moving on and pursuing 
    new relationships. But before you get a happy fairytale ending, there's a chance you'll collect a few sad love stories
     along the way. Sorry to be a downer, you guys. But it's true.
